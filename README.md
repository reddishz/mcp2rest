### MCP-to-REST Gateway Server

This project implements a generic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to function as a universal gateway for RESTful APIs. It seamlessly bridges the gap between AI assistants like Claude and any existing internal or external web service, eliminating the need for custom, per-API integrations.

The server operates as a config-driven adapter. Its core function is to translate incoming MCP JSON-RPC requests—specifically `tools/call` invocations—into fully configured HTTP requests to downstream REST endpoints. It handles parameter mapping, authentication header injection, and URL templating based on a flexible definition file (e.g., YAML). Subsequently, it transforms the raw API JSON responses into the structured text format required by the MCP standard before returning them to the AI client.

This approach provides a powerful, unified interface for AI-to-API interaction, offering significant advantages in governance, security, and maintainability. It centralizes authentication, logging, and rate limiting, making it an essential infrastructure component for safely and efficiently unlocking enterprise capabilities for next-generation AI workflows.
